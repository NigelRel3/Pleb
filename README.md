This is a test project to work with Javascript, CSS and integrating with a PHP based data transfer prototype.

The code is not intended to be a polished end product, more a prototype to help explore the possibilities of what and how this could be done.

One main aim of this project is not to use predefined libraries and as such most things are written from scratch.
